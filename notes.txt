There are a couple ways to load a js script

1. @ vite(['resources/js/grading/grading.js'])
    - add after </x-layout> at the bottom of this file
2. if layout has a scripts slot, use that
    <x - layout>
        <x -s lot:scripts>
            < script src="{ { asset('js/your-script.js') } }"></script>
            < script>
                // Your inline JavaScript
            < / script>
        < / x-slot:scripts>
    < / x-layout>
3. Using @ push and @ stack
    - in layout.blade.php, add @ stack('scripts') before </body>
    - in this file, add:
        @ push('scripts')
            <script src="{ { asset('js/your-script.js') } }"></script>
            <script>
                // Your inline JavaScript
            < / script>
        @ endpush
4. Direct sript tag in this file
    - add <script src="{ { asset('js/your-script.js') } }"></script>
        before </x-layout> at the bottom of this file
    - In the script section, use imports if needed
